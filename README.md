# 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

<p align="justify">
  I am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree at the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador, focusing on structural engineering with a specialization in Seismic-Resistant Structures. As a newcomer to GitHub, I am excited to share and collaborate on projects that reflect my dedication to structural engineering. I am eager to learn and contribute to the community, always open to feedback and the exchange of ideas. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoy creating it.
